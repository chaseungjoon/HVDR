# HVDR (Hierarchical Value-Driven Retriever)

A minimal research prototype of the **HVDR framework**, inspired by **[Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM); Wang et al., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21734)**.  
This experimental implementation demonstrates hierarchical planning and document selection concepts for research exploration. It is **not production-ready** and serves as a lightweight outline for sharing ideas with colleagues.
